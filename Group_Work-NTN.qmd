# Code Examples

This page has example code to show you can include outputs while hiding code in Quarto, as well as some tools for interpolating data in the text. 

See the raw file for examples of how to hide computational output as there is code hidden here.

```{python}
#| echo: True 
# This code will be shown, 
# but the next block will not
import os
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
# This code is not shown because echo was
# set to False in the header. You should
# think carefully about whether you want
# or need to show any code to the reader
# in the PDf.
host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
path = '~jreades/data'
file = '20250615-London-listings.parquet'

if os.path.exists(file):
  df = pd.read_parquet(file)
else: 
  df = pd.read_parquet(f'{host}/{path}/{file}')
  df.to_parquet(file)

A parenthetical citation example: There are many ways to research Airbnb [see, for example, @insideairbnb]... 

```{python}
#| output: asis
# This is one way to write dynamic text. 'As is' means
# it will interpret the result as regular Quarto markdown 
# so the below `print` statement becomes plain text with
# the size of the dataframe interpolated into the string.
# When Quarto is done running the Python code what's left
# is plain-text and that is then treated as a paragraph
# like it would be if you'd written it in Quarto.
print(f"One of way to embed output in the text looks like this: after cleaning, we were left with {df.shape[0]:,} rows of data.")
```

```{python}
# The other way is to ensure that your variables are *simple* 
# data types that Quarto can understand. So notice below that
# we just have a single, inline `{python} with the value of
# the row directly inserted into the sentence. his should also work, but is sometimes less predictably
# reliable.
row_count = f"{df.shape[0]:,}"
```
The other way is to interpolate it directly into the sentence like this (`{python} row_count `); however, I've found it less reliable and it really requires you to be careful about data types. So `{python} print(f"{df.shape[0]:,}") ` probably won't work and you'll just see some Python code instead.

And here's a nice little chart straight into the document!

ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);

## Background

简要概述伦敦短期租赁当前的争议焦点。
阐述反对党提出的政策建议及其引发争议的原因。
之前写的背景：#需要改
Background 近期，市长社会流动性顾问因非法出租公有暂住房屋的丑闻，将伦敦住房短缺与财富不平等的尖锐矛盾推向公众视野。 反对党借机提出强硬提案，要求对短期租赁（Airbnb）的房东实施强制登记并提高市政税，声称要平衡被 Airbnb 破坏的租赁和酒店市场。

本简报旨在评估这一政治驱动提案的经济合理性、社会公平性及对市长竞选的潜在政治影响。 现有分析表明，Airbnb 的商业化运营正在系统性地加剧伦敦的住房不平等问题。 造成这一现象的核心原因在于： 1.商业化挤占住房： 平台上职业房东和非法房源的存在，挤占了私人长租和酒店业的生存空间，从而损害了私人租房者的利益，并间接推高了区域房价。 2.加速区域财富不平等： 租金和房价上涨加剧了房主与非房主之间的财富差距。同时，房租压力使得低收入家庭向外伦敦迁移，加速了区域贫困的郊区化趋势。 3.社区旅游化： 商业运营引入了负面外部性（如噪音和滋扰），拉低了社区生活质量，导致社区走向“旅游化”。

## Analytical Framework and Data


这个所有人写完之后我来综合


# Question
## Q1: Is Airbnb “out of control” in London?

**Short answer**  
（一句话交代：例如
Airbnb activity in London is highly concentrated among a small subset of hosts, particularly professional hosts operating entire-home listings.）

**Evidence:**  
- 列数据，简要阐述数据，是什么，数据为（number)，数据表示了什么。


**Interpretation**  
详细阐述These patterns suggest that Airbnb activity in London is better understood
as spatially concentrated rather than uniformly excessive.

```{python}
# 这里才写 Python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd

df = pd.read_csv("data/listings.csv")
df.head()
```

## Q2: How many professional landlords are there?

**Short answer:**  
London has a relatively small number of professional landlords, totalling 5,222. These landlords play a significant role in shaping concerns about Airbnb being “out of control” in the city.

**Evidence:**  

- London has a total of **5,222 professional hosts**, accounting for **9.4% of all Airbnb hosts**.
  Professional hosts are defined as those operating **two or more entire-home listings**, a conservative threshold commonly used in the Airbnb literature to capture sustained commercial activity rather than casual home-sharing (@sainaghi2021mom).

![Share of Professional Hosts Among All Hosts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taoo2025/casa0013_fsds_finalwork/fddef7c18e555c3704d4330345c058536fb0d83b/Share%20of%20Professional%20Hosts%20Among%20All%20Hosts.png)


- Professional hosts are unevenly distributed across space and rental orientation:
  - **Inner-city long-term professional hosts:** 3,590  
  - **Inner-city short-term professional hosts:** 108  
  - **Outer-city long-term professional hosts:** 921  
  - **Outer-city short-term professional hosts:** 603  

![Composition of Professional Hosts by Location and Rental Orientation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Taoo2025/casa0013_fsds_finalwork/fddef7c18e555c3704d4330345c058536fb0d83b/Composition%20of%20Professional%20Hosts%20by%20Location%20and%20Rental%20Orientation.png)
**Definitions and Analytical Scope**

Following the Airbnb literature, professional hosts are commonly defined as hosts operating multiple listings, reflecting a shift from casual home-sharing towards commercial provision (@sainaghi2021mom). Building on this approach, this study adopts a more conservative operational definition by restricting professional hosts to those managing **two or more entire-home listings**. This refinement is particularly relevant in the context of housing inequality, as entire-home listings imply a full withdrawal of dwellings from residential use and are therefore more directly associated with pressures on the long-term housing market.

To account for heterogeneity within this group, professional hosts are further classified by **spatial location (Inner vs Outer London)** and **rental orientation (short-term vs long-term)**. The Inner–Outer London distinction follows established findings that housing pressure and wealth inequality in London are structurally organised along this divide (@travers2016housing, p. 17), and that intensive commercial activities tend to concentrate in highly connected urban cores (@arcaute2016cities). Consistent with this literature, the City of London is included as part of the inner-city core.

Rental orientation is distinguished using a **90-day threshold**, derived from London’s short-term letting regulatory framework rather than a universal academic definition. This policy-relevant boundary allows listings that are persistently withdrawn from residential use to be distinguished from more occasional forms of short-term letting, aligning the empirical classification with ongoing political and regulatory debates.

**Interpretation:**  
The grouping results indicate that professional hosts do not constitute a homogeneous group. Their behaviour in the housing market varies markedly in terms of both operating intensity and spatial distribution. In numerical terms, professional hosts remain a minority of all Airbnb hosts; in terms of housing resource use and operating intensity, they have become one of the most influential groups on the platform.

This suggests that debates over whether Airbnb is “out of control” should not be assessed solely on the basis of host counts, but should instead focus on how different types of professional hosts use housing. This finding provides essential context for evaluating the scope and potential impacts of the opposition’s proposal in the subsequent analysis.

#放到后面数据分析Q4去，The KDE and MSOA-level analyses presented here further reveal a pronounced concentration of professional hosts in Inner London, whereas their presence in Outer London is comparatively sparse. This spatial asymmetry indicates that the disruptive effects of Airbnb are likely to be unevenly distributed across the city. Consequently, policy proposals that apply uniform registration and taxation measures without accounting for inner–outer differences risk both economic inefficiency and unintended social inequity.

#放到后面数据分析Q4去，KDE and MSOA-level analyses further reveal that such high-intensity short-term rentals are spatially concentrated in Inner London. This evidence suggests that Airbnb’s disruptive effects are unevenly distributed and underscores the need for differentiated policy responses rather than uniform regulation.

##Further grouping based on short-term versus long-term rentals, though uncertain whether to select the 'availability_365' column or the 'maximum_nights' column. Therefore, first examine the median and mode of these two columns to observe the distribution pattern.
###The median availability of 189 days indicates that more than half of professional listings are unavailable for at least 176 days per year, suggesting a substantial degree of functional withdrawal from the housing market.
###By contrast, the median and modal maximum night setting of 365 indicates that most professional hosts impose no effective upper limit on booking duration, reflecting platform rule configuration rather than realised rental behaviour.
###Maximum night settings are used to identify the intended market role of professional hosts, distinguishing listings designed as long-term or quasi-hotel assets. Availability-based measures are subsequently employed to assess the intensity of commercial operation and its potential social externalities.

## Q5: Can the story be reframed positively in terms of social mobility?

**Short answer:**  
Yes, Airbnb’s uneven and seemingly uncontrolled growth can be reframed as a mechanism that makes social inequality visible, turning gentrification into a spatially governable issue and enabling a more equitable and strategic redistribution of economic opportunities and social resources.

**Evidence and framing:**  

- 1 Airbnb, a Contested Sharing Economy Platform, to a Governable Policy Object
Airbnb is one of the most prominent platforms within the so-called “sharing economy,” using peer-to-peer digital technology to connect hosts and guests and, in doing so, creating a form of short-term rental that sits between traditional residential letting and hotel accommodation (@wachsmuth2018airbnb). While short-term rental platforms are often framed in public debate as drivers of housing shortages, inequality, and gentrification, the findings of this study—read alongside the existing literature—suggest a more nuanced interpretation. Rather than viewing Airbnb solely as a source of housing pressure, it can also be understood as a lens through which underlying market dynamics become visible, creating opportunities for more targeted and effective urban governance.


- 2 Evidence of Spatial Heterogeneity
The evidence clearly shows that Airbnb’s impact on London’s housing market is not evenly distributed across the city. Although professional hosts make up only around 9% of all Airbnb hosts, they control approximately 51% of entire-home listings and account for about 41% of all entire-home booking nights. These activities are heavily concentrated in inner-city areas and are characterised by high-intensity, entire-home use, with a median operating intensity of around 293 nights per year. By contrast, professional hosts in outer-city areas operate at much lower intensity, with a median of approximately 142 nights per year. Their activity more closely resembles low-intensity, intermittent, or income-supplementary letting, rather than the systematic removal of housing from the long-term residential market. Mapping the spatial concentration of Airbnb listings further confirms that housing commercialisation pressures are clustered in a small number of inner-city areas, rather than spread evenly across London as a whole.


- 3 From “Gentrification” in London to the “Visualisation of Inequality”
In the London context, these spatial differences need to be understood against the city’s longer-term patterns of gentrification.
London has long displayed a clear inner–outer city divide: inner-city areas concentrate high-value employment, cultural capital, and investment-led housing demand, while outer-city areas primarily serve residential and social reproduction functions. This structural imbalance creates conditions in which gentrification pressures are more likely to emerge and become spatially concentrated (@gyodi2024spatial). Without effective guidance, short-term rentals in high-demand inner-city areas can reinforce these existing dynamics, accelerating gentrification, further undermining housing affordability, and increasing the risk of community displacement.

However, the spatial analysis in this study suggests that Airbnb does not shape this process in the same way across the city.
Rather than operating uniformly, it brings the sharp differences in housing use between inner and outer London into clearer view. Mapping the spatial concentration of listings shows that housing commercialisation pressures are tightly clustered in inner-city neighbourhoods, while outer-city areas display a distinctly different pattern characterised by low-intensity, supplementary short-term renting. From this perspective, short-term rentals are not simply a “gentrification accelerator,” but also a means through which previously less visible spatial inequalities become more apparent.

This pattern of spatial heterogeneity is consistent with findings in the existing literature. Previous research shows that Airbnb introduces a new and spatially uneven stream of potential rental income into housing markets, creating a “short-term rental rent gap” that is most pronounced in high-demand inner-city areas (@wachsmuth2018airbnb). At the same time, market-focused studies indicate that, under low-intensity conditions, short-term renting can serve as a way of making use of underutilised housing assets and strengthening household economic resilience (@barron2021effect). 

**Interpretation** 
Policy Implications and Recommendations

From a policy perspective, Airbnb’s expansion can be understood not simply as market activity, but as a process that reshapes housing use and highlights where pressures in the housing system are most concentrated.
In high-demand inner-city areas, short-term rentals quickly expose latent rent gaps, providing policymakers with clear and geographically identifiable targets for intervention. By contrast, in outer-city areas, legal and low-intensity short-term rental activity may offer households valuable income flexibility. Small-scale short-term rental income can help younger households manage mortgage payments or provide a supplementary source of income during periods of labour market instability, thereby strengthening household resilience. By providing an additional financial buffer, these arrangements can help individuals and families strengthen their economic resilience over time, supporting opportunities for upward social mobility across the life course.

On the other hand, equally important, making inequality visible has clear implications for how cities are governed. Rather than treating gentrification as a diffuse and hard-to-pin-down urban trend, this approach allows policymakers to identify risk areas based on concrete evidence.
As a result, the policy debate can move away from the abstract question of whether Airbnb should be restricted in general, and instead focus on more practical concerns: which locations and which forms of short-term rental activity pose genuine housing risks, and how targeted interventions can be designed without creating disproportionate social costs.

For the mayor, the key question is therefore not whether Airbnb should be tolerated or banned, but how different forms of short-term rental activity vary by location and operating intensity.
Uniform regulation, or “one-size-fits-all” restrictions, risk imposing disproportionate governance costs in non-core areas while weakening policy effectiveness in inner-city neighbourhoods where housing commercialisation pressures are most acute. By contrast, a guided approach to governance (being sensitive to spatial variation and differences in operating intensity) can both relieve housing pressures in inner-city areas and preserve the potential positive role of short-term rentals in supporting household resilience and social mobility.
Reframing Airbnb and its spatial distribution as a process that reveals, rather than simply produces, inequality can therefore support more transparent, targeted, and spatially responsive policymaking. This perspective does not deny the reality or risks of inner-city gentrification. Rather, it emphasises that by making these risks visible, measurable, and geographically specific, data-driven spatial analysis creates political and policy space for the mayor to pursue rational, differentiated action in an otherwise highly contentious housing debate.

## Overall Assessment

## Transparency and Limitations
（这些是Q2/4的，自己加自己负责的部分的Transparency and Limitations）
- This analysis relies on scraped platform data and operational definitions of professional landlords, which may under- or over-estimate true levels of commercial activity. Spatial patterns should therefore be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive.
- Operating nights are proxied using availability data.
- The 90-day threshold is policy-relevant but imperfect.
- Results describe relative patterns rather than causal effects.
